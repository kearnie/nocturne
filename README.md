Staying loyal to my usual aesthetic and everlasting motivation of making a beautiful, virtual environment… 

For starters, it was unfortunate that I didn’t have the confidence to get started and learn OpenFrameworks 
within the timeframe of this project; it is definitely something I want to pick up and utilize in the future–especially 
since this project really hammered in to me what the limits of Processing were. For an interactive environment, Processing will 
undeniably start running super slowly because of all the assets involved; this actually limited what interactivity and aesthetics 
I wanted to include in this environment, and I had to prioritize what to keep without sacrificing a sense of completion in the 
overall product.

As such I aimed for something calm (my own bias) and serene… an environment that would provide subtle and endearing movement and 
interaction potential. I definitely focused on setting up the entire environment overall, much like a stage setting, rather than 
attempting to go for quantitative assets. I wanted a well-rendered and atmospherically polished environment rather than a more 
lackluster one with more features. Basically the whole setup was contingent on object-oriented programming, something I actually 
had never done before in the Processing environment–but this was crucial here as every characteristic of the setting was its 
own object class: I worked with waves, landscapes, fireflies/particles, rain, stars, and branches and leaves (aggregated into trees), 
to carefully render each aspect in the right order to eventually stack together to become the final environment. I initially was 
inspired to include more air-related features through some beautiful OpenProcessing samples which I wanted to customize, but the 
utility of noise to render the smoke and clouds slowed down my entire program to the point that movement was hardly seen, so I had 
to abandon that. With the idealistic assets I had in mind and the further progress of how much code I’d typed with how increasingly 
sluggish my program was running, I had to make the decisions to output a workable and seamless product that still stayed aesthetic. 
I am incredibly happy with the resulting soft and subtle features, with the highlight movements from the stars, waves, and fireflies; 
and the interactions of the light particles following the user’s cursor and the movement of vectors upon clicking trees to allow for 
branch swaying and leaves scattering and falling. It is definitely not a game, or an interactive interface with a goal per say, but 
the whole point was to imagine a user mindlessly enjoying the program, as if it were a virtual art piece.

I really think the program benefits from an experience where the user is running it alone in a dark room, with headphones. 
That is how I believe the piece should be seen and felt, and funnily enough the dark room and headphones is exactly the 
environment that I mostly coded it in as I worked on it during many nights. With this setup I feel like the user would become more 
fully immersed in the cathartic and serene nature of Nocturne.

This project is definitely something I want to continue and further develop in my free time or if given the chance in the future. 
This would probably also assume that I will be developing and enhancing it in OpenFrameworks, because as of now I think I’m already 
hitting the max of what Processing will run and handle smoothly. As of now I intent to add interactions with new objects such as 
plant growth and animals, and perhaps some more precipitation and particle options.
